    In the book Concise Computer Vision An Introduction into Theory and Algorithms we see in the first chapter
    some basic statistics about images, the first one is the Mean that is defined by
    1/(Nrows * Ncols) * sum X=1 -> Ncols sum Y=1 -> Nrows I(x,y)
    But we simplify this formula like this
    first defining omega = Nrows * Ncols
    then the formula is 1/|omega| * sum (x,y) âˆˆ omega (I(x,y))
    We apply this formula to a gray scale image
